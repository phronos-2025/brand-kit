**Format**: Always capitalized with periods: P.H.R.O.N.O.S.  
**Never**: phronos, PHRONOS, Phronos, P.H.R.O.N.O.S

### Full Expansion
**Public Heuristics for Resilient Ontology, Navigation, and Observational Science**

**Breakdown**:
- **Public**: Open, transparent, accessible to all
- **Heuristics**: Practical approaches to problem-solving under uncertainty
- **Resilient**: Capable of adapting without losing core structure
- **Ontology**: Systematic categorization of what exists and how it relates
- **Navigation**: Pathfinding through complexity
- **Observational**: Empirical, measurement-based
- **Science**: Rigorous, falsifiable, cumulative knowledge

## Core Concepts

### Strategic Foresight
**Definition**: The systematic anticipation of future possibilities and their implications for present decision-making, extending beyond 3-year planning horizons.

**Usage**: Not "forecasting" (predicting specific outcomes) or "planning" (operational execution).

**Related Terms**: Long-term thinking, anticipatory governance, future studies

---

### Signal-to-Noise Ratio
**Definition**: The proportion of actionable, high-quality information to irrelevant or misleading data in an information ecosystem.

**Context**: Borrowed from communications engineering, adapted for information environments.

**Measurement**: Higher ratio = better information quality; lower ratio = more noise.

---

### Epistemic Humility
**Definition**: The recognition of the limits of one's knowledge and the active cultivation of uncertainty tolerance in decision-making processes.

**Not**: Self-deprecation, lack of confidence, or indecisiveness  
**Is**: Honest acknowledgment of what we don't know

**Practice**: Explicitly stating limitations, updating beliefs with new evidence, inviting critique

---

### Ontological Resilience
**Definition**: The capacity of a knowledge framework to maintain coherence while incorporating new and contradictory information.

**Example**: A good scientific theory can accommodate anomalies without collapsing entirely.

**Opposite**: Brittle frameworks that reject any contradictory evidence

---

### Observatory
**Definition**: In P.H.R.O.N.O.S. context, a digital platform for systematic observation, documentation, and analysis of strategic foresight phenomena.

**Not**: A physical telescope facility  
**Is**: A research infrastructure for continuous monitoring

**Components**: Documentation, datasets, analysis tools, peer review system

---

### Instruments
**Definition**: Interactive tools that enable structured engagement with AI frameworks to measure decision-making patterns.

**Examples**: Chat interfaces with constrained LLMs, survey tools, data collection applications

**Purpose**: Generate data for analysis while providing utility to users

---

### Framework
**Definition**: A structured set of concepts, assumptions, and methods that guide analysis or constrain AI behavior.

**In P.H.R.O.N.O.S.**: System prompts that shape LLM responses to measure specific decision-making patterns

**Types**: Theoretical frameworks (concepts), operational frameworks (methods), LLM frameworks (constraints)

---

## Document Types

### Living Document
**Status**: Green badge, pulsing indicator  
**Definition**: A document actively maintained and updated as new evidence emerges.

**Version**: < 1.0 (beta) or ≥ 1.0 with ongoing updates  
**Expectation**: May change; check changelog regularly

---

### Stable Document
**Status**: Blue badge, checkmark  
**Definition**: A document that has undergone peer review and is considered methodologically sound.

**Version**: ≥ 1.0  
**Changes**: Only for corrections, not substantive updates

---

### Archived Document
**Status**: Gray badge, archive icon  
**Definition**: A historical snapshot no longer being updated; preserved for reference.

**Purpose**: Version history, reproducibility  
**Access**: Read-only, linked from current versions

---

## Methodology Terms

### LLM Constraint Framework
**Definition**: A system prompt that structures how a language model responds, used to measure decision-making patterns.

**Purpose**: Isolate specific cognitive tendencies by limiting AI's response space

**Example**: A framework requiring consideration of 10-year horizons vs. immediate concerns

---

### Synthetic Dataset
**Definition**: Data generated by LLMs simulating diverse human responses, used as comparison baselines.

**Not**: "Fake data"  
**Is**: Computationally generated comparison points

**Size**: Typically 10,000+ simulated responses per framework

---

### Open Peer Review
**Definition**: Public, transparent review process where anyone can critique and contribute to research.

**Different from**: Traditional anonymous peer review  
**Benefit**: Broader expertise, faster iteration, public accountability

**Process**: Publish → Invite critique → Update → Acknowledge contributors

---

## Research Stages

### Alpha
**Definition**: Early-stage research with preliminary findings.

**Status**: Unstable, subject to major revisions  
**Sharing**: Internal or small group only  
**Version**: 0.x

---

### Beta
**Definition**: Research ready for public feedback but not yet finalized.

**Status**: Living document, active peer review  
**Sharing**: Public, soliciting critique  
**Version**: 0.8 - 0.99

---

### Release
**Definition**: Finalized research published as stable reference.

**Status**: Stable document, peer-reviewed  
**Sharing**: Public, canonical version  
**Version**: 1.0+

---

## Technical Terms

### Docusaurus
**Definition**: The static site generator used for Observatory documentation.

**Why**: Built for documentation, supports versioning, has strong React integration

---

### Next.js
**Definition**: The React framework used for Instruments interactive UI.

**Why**: Server-side rendering, good performance, strong ecosystem

---

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Wrong
- "Phronos Observatory" (missing periods)
- "strategic forecasting" (we say "foresight")
- "AI predictions" (we measure patterns, not predict)
- "closed beta" (we practice open science)
- "proprietary data" (we publish everything)

### ✓ Correct
- "P.H.R.O.N.O.S. Observatory"
- "strategic foresight"
- "AI framework responses"
- "open beta"
- "open datasets"
